# Algorithm
<h2>Step 1:</h2>
Start the Terminal:
Open the terminal window in your Red Hat Linux environment.

Navigate to the YUM Repository Directory.
Move to the directory where all repository configuration files are stored, which is /etc/yum.repos.d/.

Create a New Repository File.
Create a new file named classroom.repo using a text editor with administrative privileges.

Add Repository Details.
Inside the file, define two repositories — one for AppStream and one for BaseOS — by specifying their names, base URLs, and enabling them while disabling GPG checks.

Save and Exit the File.
Save the changes made to the file and close the editor.

Clean the YUM Cache.
Clear any existing metadata or cached data to ensure the new repository information is recognized properly.

Verify the Repository Configuration.
Display the list of repositories to confirm that the newly created AppStream and BaseOS repositories appear in the output.
