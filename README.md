# Aim:

To create,verify configure a Repository File in RHEL

# Algorithm:
<h2>Step 1:</h2>
Start the Terminal:
Open the terminal window in your Red Hat Linux environment.
<h2>Step 2:</h2>
Navigate to the YUM Repository Directory.
Move to the directory where all repository configuration files are stored, which is /etc/yum.repos.d/.
<h2>Step 3:</h2>
Create a New Repository File.
Create a new file named classroom.repo using a text editor with administrative privileges.
<h2>Step 4:</h2>
Add Repository Details.
Inside the file, define two repositories — one for AppStream and one for BaseOS — by specifying their names, base URLs, and enabling them while disabling GPG checks.
<h2>Step 5:</h2>
Save and Exit the File.
Save the changes made to the file and close the editor.
<h2>Step 6</h2>
Clean the YUM Cache.
Clear any existing metadata or cached data to ensure the new repository information is recognized properly.
<h2>Step 7</h2>
Verify the Repository Configuration.
Display the list of repositories to confirm that the newly created AppStream and BaseOS repositories appear in the output.
